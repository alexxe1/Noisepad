An open-source soundpad application that lets you manipulate audio in real time with advanced features like pitch shifting, voice recording, and audio reversal.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT
<b>Noisepad</b> requires a virtual microphone to play sounds in applications like <b>Discord</b> or <b>TeamSpeak</b>.  
I recommend using [VB-Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable) for this purpose.

> [!NOTE]
> When done installing [VB-Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable), make sure to have your speaker and microphone selected as default.

## How to Set Up [VB-Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable)

### Step 1: Open Sound Settings
1. Open the **Sound Settings** in Windows by searching for ‚ÄúSound‚Äù in the Start Menu, or by pressing `Windows + R` and typing `mmsys.cpl`

## üîàHow do I use Noisepad with Discord or TeamSpeak (or any other application that uses a microphone)?
Just go to the application's settings and make sure to select `VB-Cable Output` as your microphone.

## üêß Can I use Noisepad on Linux or macOS?
Not yet. Noisepad currently depends on [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio), a Windows-only audio library.  
However, since it's built with [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/), cross-platform support *might* be possible in the future ‚Äî community contributions are welcome!
