# Noisepad
An open-source soundpad application that lets you manipulate audio in real time with advanced features like pitch shifting, voice recording, and audio reversal.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT
<b>Noisepad</b> requires a virtual microphone to play sounds in applications like <b>Discord</b> or <b>TeamSpeak</b>.  
I recommend using [VB-Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable) for this purpose.

### How to Set Up [VB-Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable)
1. Open the **Sound Settings** in Windows by searching for ‚ÄúSound‚Äù in the Start Menu, or by pressing `Windows + R` and typing `mmsys.cpl`

2. In the **Recording** tab, find your microphone and double-click it

3. Go to the **Listen** tab, check the option **"Listen to this device"**, and select **"CABLE Input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)"** from the dropdown below

## üêß Can I Use Noisepad on Linux or macOS?
Not at the moment. Noisepad heavily relies on [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio), a Windows-only audio library.  
However, since the project is built with [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/), cross-platform support *could* be possible in the future ‚Äî though it is not currently planned.
